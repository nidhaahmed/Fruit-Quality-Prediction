# Fruit Classification with CNN

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fruits as either "fresh" or "rotten" based on images. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of fruit images and can predict the freshness status of new images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset of fruit images organized into folders for training and validation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for model development and experimentation.
- `src/`: Python scripts and modules for model building, training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy pillow
